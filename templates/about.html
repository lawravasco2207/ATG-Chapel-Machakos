        Mentee Ministries stands as a shining example of the transformative
        power of visionary leadership and dedicated service. Under the guidance
        of Bishop Lazarus Musyoka, this ministry has not only enriched the
        fabric of the church but has also equipped the youth with the tools to
        become ambassadors of the gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we reflect on the impact of Mentee Ministries, we extend our
        heartfelt gratitude to Bishop Lazarus for his foresight and dedication
        to nurture the next generation of church leaders.
